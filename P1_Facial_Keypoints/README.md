# Project : Facial Keypoint Detection

In this project, we build a facial keypoint detection system 
that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location
of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. 

Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.
